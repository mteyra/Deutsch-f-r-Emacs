# emacs-german-filetype
An emacs configuration for .de or .deutsch filetypes.

Ideally, this project will grow into a module for Language learning on Emacs. <br/>
However for now it is a playground for myself, wherein I write my daily diary in german using ".de", until I've tweeked it to perfection.
